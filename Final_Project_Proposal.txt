Final Project Proposal


Name of the Project: Hangman
Goal of the Project: To complete a working hangman game program. 
Features (+ brief descriptions):
	•Categories (read from .txt files)
		◦Animals
		◦Colors
		◦Food
		◦Countries
		◦Sports
		◦Hobbies
		◦UMW (General - buildings, professors, traditions, etc.)
		◦Challenge
	•Guesses
		◦Keep a running list of number of guesses used for high scores
		◦Letter
			▪Get charAt(0) from text box
			▪If string length is more than 1, int, or special char error message to enter a new guess
			▪For each appearance of letter, replace the underline with that letter using labels 
			▪If no appearances add it to a list of wrong letters and add a limb to the person
		◦Word
			▪Same text box, but with no mismatch exception 
			▪If the word is not the same as the hidden word, add a limb
			▪User does not get to know which letter(s) is/are wrong 
	•High Scores
		◦File with top 5 scores with names of players and category played
		◦User will enter name at program startup
		◦If there are high scores, rip them to an ArrayList of score objects
			▪Score object will have player name, score, and category as instance variables
		◦At start of program, high scores will be displayed from lowest to highest average guess per length
		◦Score class
			▪Take the number of guesses used and number of latter in the word and divide then multiply by 100 for the score
			▪Closest to 100 or under 100 are better scores than higher than 100
			▪When the player is done guessing, if successful a new score object is created
			▪Compare to high scores already existing and if higher, replace and then erase high score file & write the array list of high scores to the high score file
	•Hangman Display
		◦Permanent gallows independent of categories 
		◦For hangman:
			▪Either add images of hangman with one more limb each time
			▪Or draw a new limb each time 
			▪(We’re not sure which one will be better)
			▪Labels to display underscores for unknown letters
			▪These labels will be replaced when correct letters are guessed
			▪Labels next to the gallows to display wrong guesses
			▪When full words are guessed, no incorrect letters are added here
